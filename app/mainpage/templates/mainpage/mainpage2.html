<h3>Input Data</h3>
<p>
The data used for the analysis are the FibaLiveStats play-by-play data generated by the statisticians during games. The data are officially provided by the GeniusSports, the author of the FibaLiveStats software.
</p>
<p>
Now, to understand the quality, or in other words, to know if we can trust the input data, we need to understand what the GapRate is.
</p>

<h3>GapRate</h3>
<p>
One of the most important things when examining the input data is checking if there are no “gaps” or “holes” in the input data.<br>
Let's imagine that we have a game in which one team possession lasts 3 or 4 minutes. We can certainly say there are some missing data or “gaps” in the input file, because clearly there is more that should happen during that time and, in fact, the teams should’ve switched possessions multiple times during that span.
</p>
<p>
Now, to understand the GapRate, let’s have a look at the following hypothetical example of a play-by-play file:
</p>
<br>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Play Id</th>
    <th>Team</th>
    <th>Play</th>
    <th>Seconds Between Plays</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>44</td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>rebound</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>45</td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>shot made</td>
    <td>25</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>46</td>
    <td>B</td>
    <td>turnover</td>
    <td>26</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>47</td>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>shot made</td>
    <td>27</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>
We see that the time registered between plays is certainly wrong, as it should not exceed 24 seconds. So in the above example we would have 1,2 and 3 seconds “above the limit” for the plays 45, 46 and 47, respectively. So our “gap” sums to 6 seconds.
</p>
<p>
GapRate is the relation between the “gap” in seconds to the whole game time (2400 seconds if there are no overtimes). In our example:<br>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">6/2400 = 0.25%</h5>
</p>
